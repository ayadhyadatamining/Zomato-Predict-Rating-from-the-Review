# Help Zomato Predict Rating from the Review 
Objective: Using NLP and machine learning, make a model to predict the rating in a review 
based on the content of the text review. This will help identify cases with a mismatch. 
# Problem Statement: 
Zomato is Indiaâ€™s largest platform for discovering restaurants and ordering food. It operates in 
India as well as a few cities internationally. Bangalore is one of the biggest customers and 
restaurant bases for Zomato with 4 to 5 million users using the platform each month. 
Users on the platform can also post reviews of restaurants and provide a rating accompanying the 
review. The content in the reviews should ideally reflect the rating provided by the customer. In 
many cases, there is a mismatch, owing to multiple reasons, where the rating does not match the 
customer review. The reviews and rating match is very important as it builds customer trust on 
the platform and helps the user get an accurate picture of the restaurant. 
You, as a data scientist, need to enable the identification and cleanup of such cases to ensure the 
ratings reflect the reviews and that the reviews seem trustworthy to the customer. You will need 
to use NLP techniques in conjunction with machine learning models to predict the rating from 
the review text.
